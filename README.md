# WSL-Machine-Learning

The goal of this project is to create a fully hands off bot that will participate in our friend groups Fantasy Surfer league for the 2024 World Surf League (WSL) season. The bot will scrape the WSL website to collect relevant information and stats on each of the surfers for each of the 11 events (competitions) and use that data to make predictions about how well each surfer will perform. It will then login to its own profile and create its team.
