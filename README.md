# WSL Machine Learning Project

The goal of this project is to create a fully hands-off bot that will participate in our friend group's Fantasy Surf League for the 2024 World Surf League (WSL) season. The bot will scrape the WSL website to collect relevant information and stats on each of the surfers for each of the 11 events (competitions) and use that data to make predictions about how well each surfer will perform. It will then sign into its own profile and create its team.

Fantasy Surf is similar to other sports fantasy leagues. Each player selects a team of athletes (8 male and 4 female) for each event. There are 3 tiers that you select the athletes from: A, B, and C. The tiers are based on the current ranking of the athletes.

There are 10 events in the WSL season: 9 Regular season events and 1 final event. There is a mid-season cut after event #5 where only the top 24 male and 12 female athletes continue the rest of the regular season. After event #10, only the top 5 male and top 5 female athletes move on to the final event where a world champion is determined. This season is shortened due to the 2024 Paris Olympic Games where many of these athletes will be competing at Teahupo'o in July.
